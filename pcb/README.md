# Analog Terminal Bell PCB

This directory contains the PCB design for the analog terminal bell.

## PCB

The PCB is designed using KiCad.  If you don't want to deal with KiCad, it's no
problem.  Just upload the `gerbers.zip` file to any PCB manufacturer and you
should be on your way!

## Components

Here are the components needed:
